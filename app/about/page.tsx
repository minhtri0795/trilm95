        My name is Minh Tri. Iâ€™m currently working as a Development Team Lead at
        Saigon Digital where Iâ€™m collaborate with other software developers,
        marketing analysts and directors to plan, develop and
        maintain website for our enterprise clients worldwide.

        I am passionate about developing beautiful, engaging, and
        high-performance web applications using the latest web
        technologies and AI integration. I am especially interested in Jamstack and modern web tools,
        so I like to work with Next.js, Gatsby.js,
        TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vercel, Strapi, Contentful, and Storybook.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[16px] leading-7 my-4">
        Beyond development, I am also interested in SEO and marketing, and
        have expanded my knowledge and skillset in these areas throughout my
        career.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[16px] leading-7 my-4">
        Currently, I'm working on building open-source projects, learning more
        about AI, and working on full-stack projects. When I'm
        not working, I enjoy running. If you'd like to collaborate on any of
        these projects, or for any other reason, please feel free to reach out
        to me ðŸ’– !
