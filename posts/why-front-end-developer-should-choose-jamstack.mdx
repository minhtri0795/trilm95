Hi folks, as a front-end developler I have build some project with JAM stack and
I think it is nice to share why we consider using JAM stack.

## What I built

A JAM stack website with Gatsby js as Front-end libbary and Wordpress as
headless CMS.

## Why you should choose

### 1. Improved Developer Experience

Front-end visuals like layout, graphics, theme, etc., and back-end get decoupled, the development team can work effortlessly.

With the back end, developers can opt for their favorite framework to provide an improved user experience throughout the project development.

The front end lets the developers adapt the platform through APIs. That way they get all they require for the job and use their preferred programming language.

Moreover, JAMstack developers get advantages from different conveniences:

- Developers can reuse the APIâ€™s functionality for various sites with reusable APIs rather than building fresh ones from scratch every time they want to change or a new feature.
- Jamstack is an excellent environment for the Agile methodology. The development team can effortlessly shift from one tool to another as well as experiment with new ideas for higher productivity and efficiency. It also saves money.
- As the front end is isolated from the back end, there is no need to get into the code whenever you want to tweak your project. It helps your business to respond to changes faster.

### 2. Speed

The reason behind high-performing JAMstack-based websites is the prebuilt content. It aids in building a website instead of creating it in real time. Thus, the entire process is just quicker.

Moreover, it serves pre-built markup and content on a CDN that helps clients/users to get the content rapidly, better, and easily.

It enhances the speed, has fewer lags, no slowdowns, and no issues with loading sites. When you develop your platform with best practices, it will skyrocket performance.

### 3. Lower Costs

Working with JAMstack is much more budget-friendly than spending in a giant and inflexible framework.

Using CDN and a static site generator, there is no need to invest in servers, data storage, and maintenance.

A static site generator needs less computing power as you can be free from responding to on-demand requests. CDN enables quick data transfer between the server and client side.

Additionally, when development teams use APIs and third-party applications to deal with DevOps, you do not need to invest more in additional applications. Serverless functions also mitigate costs as you use lesser resources.

## In a Nutshell

The developers always aim to build the best experience possible. Along with appropriate implementation, results matter most. Developing a quick and excellent website should be the fundamental objective of each brand to offer a superior user experience.

JAMstack is a modern approach to thinking about app development and delivery. The architecture is tailored to plug-and-play services based on your requirements. It helps to mitigate overall development costs dramatically and deliver better customer satisfaction.
