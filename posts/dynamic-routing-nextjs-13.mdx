[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) version 13 introduced the new file-system based router built on top of [React Server Components](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components)
with support for layouts nested routing and more.

Currently, we will have a slight difference in defining a dynamic router for a Next.js app. Firstly, we need to look at something new from Next.js 13.

## The app Directory

The new router works in a new directory named app. The app directory works alongside the pages directory to allow for incremental adoption.

In the `app` directory:

- Folders are used to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the hierarchy from the root folder down to a final leaf folder.
  Each folder in a route represents a route segment. Each route segment is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.
- Files are used to create UI that is shown for the route segment. A special `page.js` file is used to make route segments publicly accessible.

## Dynamic Segments

A Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a folderâ€™s name in square brackets: [folderName].

For example, a simple blog could include the following route app/blog/[slug]/page.js where [slug] is the Dynamic Segment for blog posts.

```tsx:/app/[slug]/page.tsx
export default function Post({ params }) {
  return <div>My Post</div>;
}
```

<div class="table">

|           Route            |  Example URL   |       params       |
| :------------------------: | :------------: | :----------------: |
| `app/post/[slug]/page.tsx` | `/post/post-1` | `{ slug: post-1 }` |

</div>

## Generate Static Params

The `generateStaticParams` function introduced with next js 13 to replace `getStaticePath` and `getStaticProps` to define the list of route segment parameters that will be statically generated at build time.

```tsx:/app/[slug]/page.tsx
export default function Post({ params }) {
  const post = fetch(`https://example-api/post/${params.slug}`)
  );
  return <div>{post.title}</div>;
}

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getPosts();

  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }));
}
```

The value returned by generateStaticParams is used to generate a list of static segments. Each segment receives the value of the returned object as their params prop.

With this method, you can create a dynamic router for your Next.js 13 app.
