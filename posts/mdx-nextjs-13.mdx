[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) version 13 introduced the `/app` directory, a new way of defining routes in your application.  
In this article, we'll go over the basics of using [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to render MDX files with Next.js 13 and TypeScript.  
The code we'll be writing in this article is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/minhtri0795/lmtri95).

## Context

First, let's quickly go through some technical concepts in case you didn't work with MDX and Next.js a lot:

- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is essentially a set of unified plugins. unified is a generic interface for processing content as structured data. Thanks to this, I was able to write granular plugins to customize how I use MDX quite extensively.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13) is built on top of Webpack and loads MDX from Contentlayer.
- [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) Contentlayer makes working with content easy for developers. It't content SDK to transforms MDX file to JSON data so can consume by Next js app.

# Part 1 : Setup project

## Next js app

First, we'll need to create a new Next.js 13 app:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --experimental-app
# or
yarn create next-app --experimental-app
# or
pnpm create next-app --experimental-app
```

We will test to make sure the app is working. We will use yarn for this tutorial. 
However, if you like, you may just easily use NPM. Run the code below:
```bash
yarn dev
```
You should see our app available on http://localhost:3000.

## Add Tailwind
We will use Tailwind CSS for styling as we go without much extra effort, let’s quickly set up Tailwind for our project.
Run the command below to install Tailwind:

```bash 
yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

After the installation is complete, run the init command below to generate both `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.

Now within your tailwind.config.js file, add the following:

```js:/tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Add TailwindCSS styling to `global.css`

```css:/styles/global.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Lastly, we need to install `@tailwindcss/typography` to enable Tailwind styles to be applied to our Markdown(MDX) files.

```bash
yarn add @tailwindcss/typography
```
We then need to add it as a plugin to our Tailwind configurations. Go to tailwind.config.js and add the code below.

```bash
plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
],
```

Now let’s move on to set up Contentlayer [Part 2](/blog/mdx-nextjs-13-part-2).
