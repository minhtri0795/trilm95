[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) version 13 introduced the `/app` directory, a new way of defining routes in your application.  
In this article, we'll go over the basics of using [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to render MDX files with Next.js 13 and TypeScript.  
The code we'll be writing in this article is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/minhtri0795/lmtri95).

## Context

First, let's quickly go through some technical concepts in case you didn't work with MDX and Next.js a lot:

- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is essentially a set of unified plugins. unified is a generic interface for processing content as structured data. Thanks to this, I was able to write granular plugins to customize how I use MDX quite extensively.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13) is built on top of Webpack and loads MDX from Contentlayer.
- [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) Contentlayer makes working with content easy for developers. It't content SDK to transforms MDX file to JSON data so can consume by Next js app.

# Part 1 : Nextjs

## Setup

First, we'll need to create a new Next.js 13 app:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --experimental-app
# or
yarn create next-app --experimental-app
# or
pnpm create next-app --experimental-app
```

## Creating a Layout

Create new layout for all pages at: `app/layout.tsx`

```tsx:/app/layout.tsx
import Header from "~/components/Header";
import Footer from "~/components/Footer";
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={InterFont.className}>
          <Header />
          <main className="main">
            {children}
          </main>
          <Footer />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Creating a Blog UI

Create new blog template at: `app/blog/page.tsx`

```tsx:/app/blog/page.tsx
export default function Blog({ params }) {
  return <h1>My blogs:</h1>;
}
```

Now you can access to http://localhost:3000/blog to see you blogs template

## Creating a Post UI

Create new blog template at: `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`

```tsx:/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
export default function Post({ params }) {
  return <h1>{params.slug}</h1>;
}
```

Now you can access to post with any slug and this slug sent to params props and render on dynamic title.
Example: http://localhost:3000/blog/post-1
